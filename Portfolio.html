				Hot on the heels of last year’s summer blockbuster, Battle of Gods, Dragon Ball Z is back in theaters. Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ is the second film personally supervised by the series creator himself, Akira Toriyama. The new movie showcases the return of Frieza – one of the most iconic villains of all time.

				Even the complete obliteration of his physical form can’t stop the galaxy’s most evil overlord. After years in spiritual purgatory, Frieza has been resurrected and plans to take his revenge on the Z-Fighters of Earth. Facing off against Frieza’s powerful new form, and his army of 1,000 soldiers, Goku and Vegeta must reach new levels of strength in order to protect Earth from their vengeful nemesis.

			<h4 style="font-size: 150%; color: purple;text-align: center;">Raditz</h4>
			<p style="color: white; text-align: center;text-orientation: justify; width: 80%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
			Raditz is a powerful Saiyan warrior from Planet Vegeta. He comes to Earth in search of a man he calls "Kakarot". Using his scouter, he finds Kakarot, who turns out to be Goku, and insists that he leaves Earth with him. When Goku refuses, he abducts his young son, Gohan, and demands that Goku slaughters 100 Earthlings if he ever wants to see Gohan again. A battle ensues, and Goku's enemy, Piccolo, joins forces with Goku to take down Raditz. Just when things are getting desperate, Gohan appears and sends an attack flying into Raditz's chest. Badly injured, Raditz is now vulnerable, and Piccolo finishes him off.

			<p style="color: white;text-align: center;text-orientation: justify; width: 80%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; ">
			Vegeta arrives on earth after he receives Raditz’s dying message. But instead of using the Dragon Balls to wish for Raditz’s resurrection, he wishes for immortality. Impressed with Raditz’s destruction, Vegeta waits for Goku to return so he can fight the great warrior himself. Stunned by Goku’s great power, Vegeta asks him to join his team. When Goku refuses, the battle between the two Saiyans wages on, eventually resulting in Vegeta’s retreat.

			<p style="color: white;text-align: center;text-orientation: justify; width: 80%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; ">
			A ruthless and powerful Galactic Emperor, Lord Frieza proves time and time again that he will do whatever it takes to conquer the universe. He arrives on Namek to search for the planet’s dragon balls and make a wish for immortality. After he reveals his involvement in Planet Vegeta’s destruction, it becomes clear that he genuinely enjoys the death and destruction he causes, making him one of the most vile villains Goku has ever faced.

			<p style="color: white;text-align: center;text-orientation: justify; width: 80%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; ">
			The Ginyu Force is a team of elite warriors. Rather than pledging allegiance to any one organization, they are a group of freelancers who hire themselves out to various evil forces. In the Frieza Saga, Frieza hires them to defeat Vegeta, Goku, Gohan, and Krillin, but they’re no match for the Earth defenders’ incredible strength.

			Cell is also an android designed by Dr. Gero who possesses the powers of the greatest fighters in the universe, including Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, and Frieza. Cell can absorb the powers of other humans and androids, and his one true desire is to be the strongest being in the universe. After numerous close calls, Cell is finally destroyed for good by Gohan.

			<p style="color: white;text-align: center;text-orientation: justify; width: 80%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; ">
			Babadi is an evil alien wizard who plans to revive an ancient demon using stolen energy from the fighters competing in the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament. Goku and his friends attempt to intervene, but when Babadi casts a spell on Vegeta, turning his power against Goku, they fail to prevent the return of MajinBuu.</p>
			
				<h4 style="font-size: 150%; color: purple;text-align: center;">Buu</h4>
			<p style="color: white;text-align: center;text-orientation: justify; width: 80%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; ">
			One of the most powerful entities in Dragon Ball Z, MajinBuu takes many forms throughout the series. In the beginning, he’s used as a pawn by the evil wizards Bibidi and Babadi, but eventually he breaks free from their influence. When he attempts to expel the evil from his body, he loses himself to the dark side and Goku has to put a stop to his rampage.</p>

			Goku, the hero of Dragon Ball Z, is the most powerful warrior on Earth. In Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, he faces his most dangerous opponent ever: Beerus, the God of Destruction.

			<p style="color: white;text-align: center;text-orientation: justify; width: 80%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto; padding-bottom: 50px;">
				Beerus, an ancient and powerful God of Destruction, has the ability to destroy planet Earth without breaking a sweat. He is, by far, the most dangerous opponent Goku and the Z Fighters have ever faced. Easily annoyed to the point of rage, Beerus is prone to chaotic rampages that reduce everything in his path to smoldering piles of rubble.
